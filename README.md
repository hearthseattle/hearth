# Seattle Homeless to Hearth Pipeline

   Seattle has the third largest homeless population in the country. Fortunately, it also has some of the best and numerous 
resources to offer people in need. As organizations continue to pop up and support networks grow, it is becoming increasingly
difficult to guide people to the organizations that can meet their specific needs. This project aims to address this problem 
in the following ways:

   - Aggregate resources into **one**, **reliable** web application

   - **Categorize organizations** based on the specific care they provide

   - **Tailor effective search results** based on individual needs

Our ultimate goal is to connect people in need to the care they require as quickly and easily as possible.
